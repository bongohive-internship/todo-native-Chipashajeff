## rn-todo
Use the same logic from react-2 assignment to create a to-do in react-native


The overall goal of this assignment is to create a to-do app.
It should have the following:

- an input field to add an item
- List of all items added
- <del>Checkbox on each item to mark complete</del>
- <del>Completed items should look different</del>
- <del>You should be able to remove each item</del>

Good to have.

- Have different files that contain different components
- reuse components as much as possible
